🧑‍💻 Python OOP Project – Person, Student & Employee Management

This project is a Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) application that allows users to manage and interact with Person, Student, and Employee objects through a menu-driven interface. It demonstrates key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, and includes input validation, error handling, and data export functionalities.

🔹 Features

Create New Entries: Add Person, Student, or Employee objects with validated input.

Search & Access Data: Search by ID, access objects by index, or list all names and IDs.

Polymorphism: Display all objects showing their type and attributes.

Calculate Statistics: Compute the average age of all stored entries.

Data Persistence: Save all data to a CSV file using pandas for future use.

Robust Input Handling: Includes validation for digits, alphabetic input, and handles invalid keys or indices gracefully.

Menu Interface: Interactive console menu dynamically generated from Menu_Options enum.

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts

Python 3

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

Inheritance (Student and Employee inherit from Person)

Polymorphism (shared interface for all objects)

Encapsulation (private attributes with getter methods)

Modules: pandas, os

Input validation and error handling

CSV export and data management

📁 Project Structure

Person.py – Base class representing a generic person.

Student.py – Subclass representing a student.

Employee.py – Subclass representing an employee.

Options.py – Enum defining menu options for the interface.

library_functions.py – Helper functions for input validation and dictionary operations.

final project of python.py – Main file that runs the program and integrates all modules.

Key Learning Outcomes✅

Solid understanding of OOP principles in Python.

Experience in menu-driven application design.

Handling data validation, error management, and CSV exports.

Demonstrated ability to combine multiple modules into a cohesive project.
